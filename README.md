# English-Learning-Daily
Welcome to the *English Learning Daily* repository! This project is dedicated to helping me improve my English language skills through consistent, daily practice.

**Project Structure**

The repository is organized by weeks, with each week containing daily markdown files where I document new vocabulary, grammar structures, and notes from my studies.

**Directory Structure**

```bash
English-Learning-Daily/

├── Week-1/

└── README.md

```

**How It Works**

- **Daily Notes:** Each day, I create a new markdown file using a predefined template to record the date, vocabulary, grammar tenses, translations, and any additional notes.
- **Weekly Review:** At the end of each week, I review the week's notes, update the vocabulary list, and reflect on areas for improvement.

**Template**

Each daily file follows this structure:
